"We continued to build on our momentum and deliver industry-leading results and attract more Canadians than any other carrier," said Tony Staffieri, President and CEO. "We delivered strong market share, record margins in Cable and Wireless, and we are on track to deliver our full-year targets. I'm proud of our team for delivering an eleventh straight quarter of growth and sector-leading performance while strengthening our balance sheet."

## Strategic Highlights

The five objectives set out below guide our work and decision-making as we further improve our operational execution and make well-timed investments to grow our core businesses and deliver increased shareholder value. Below are some highlights for the quarter.

## Build the biggest and best networks in the country

- · Awarded Canada's most reliable 5G network by umlaut in July 2024.
- Recognized as Canada's fastest and most reliable Internet by Opensignal in July 2024.
- · Delivered 4 Gbps download and 1 Gbps upload speeds with DOCSIS 4.0 modem technology trial.

## Deliver easy to use, reliable products and services

- · Launched home Internet and TV services across Quebec.
- Introduced multi-gigabit speeds to 70% of our Internet footprint.
- · Introduced a program to help newcomers build credit and finance a new smartphone through a partnership with Nova Credit.

## Be the first choice for Canadians

- · Attracted 227,000 net combined mobile phone and Internet customers.
- Signed an agreement with BCE Inc. (Bell) to become the majority owner of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE).
- · Launched Bravo in Canada and announced plans to launch TV channels for HGTV, Food Network, Magnolia, Discovery ID, and Discovery.

## Be a strong national company investing in Canada

- · Invested $977 million in capital expenditures, further strengthening and growing our networks.
- Announced a partnership with SenseNet to bring wildfire detection technology to communities.
- · Became the first-ever presenting sponsor of the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival.

## Be the growth leader in our industry

- Reported industry-leading margins in our Wireless and Cable operations.
- · Generated free cash flow of $915 million, up 23%, and cash flow from operating activities of $1,893 million.

## MLSE Transaction

On September 18, 2024, we announced an agreement with BCE Inc. (Bell) to acquire Bell's indirect 37.5% ownership stake in Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Inc. (MLSE) for a purchase price of $4.7 billion subject to certain adjustments, payable in cash (MLSE Transaction). We expect to finance a portion of the purchase price with funding from private investors and we do not expect financing of the MLSE Transaction will affect our debt leverage ratio outlook. The MLSE Transaction will also provide Bell the opportunity to renew its existing MLSE broadcast and sponsorship rights over the long-term at fair market value. This includes access to content rights for 50% of Toronto Maple Leafs regional games and 50% of Toronto Raptors games for which MLSE controls the rights. The MLSE Transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including sports league and regulatory approvals. When the MLSE Transaction closes, we will be the largest owner of MLSE, with a controlling interest in 75% of MLSE.

MLSE owns the Toronto Maple Leafs (NHL), Toronto Raptors (NBA), Toronto FC (MLS), the Toronto Argonauts (CFL), various minor league teams, and associated real estate holdings, such as Scotiabank Arena. The MLSE Transaction will add to our existing sports portfolio, including ownership of the Toronto Blue Jays, Rogers Centre , and Sportsnet .

## Quarterly Financial Highlights

## Revenue

Total revenue and total service revenue each increased by 1% this quarter, driven by revenue growth in our Wireless and Media businesses.

Wireless service revenue increased by 2% this quarter, primarily as a result of the cumulative impact of growth in our mobile phone subscriber base over the past year. Wireless equipment revenue decreased by 1%, primarily as a result of fewer device upgrades by existing customers.

Cable revenue decreased by 1% this quarter, improving sequentially, as a result of continued competitive promotional activity and declines in our Home Phone and Satellite subscriber bases.

Media revenue increased by 11% this quarter primarily as a result of higher sports-related revenue.

## Adjusted EBITDA and margins

Consolidated adjusted EBITDA increased 6% this quarter, and our adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 230 basis points, as a result of full realization of our synergy program associated with the Shaw Transaction together with ongoing cost efficiencies.

Wireless adjusted EBITDA increased by 5%, primarily due to the flow-through impact of higher revenue as discussed above in conjunction with ongoing cost efficiencies. This gave rise to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 66.1%, up 220 basis points.

Cable adjusted EBITDA increased by 5% due to the aforementioned synergy program and ongoing cost efficiencies. This gave rise to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 57.5%, up 330 basis points.

Media adjusted EBITDA increased by 25% this quarter, primarily due to higher revenue as discussed above, partially offset by higher Toronto Blue Jays expenses, including game day-related costs.

## Net income and adjusted net income

Net income increased by $625 million this quarter to $526 million, primarily as a result of the $422 million loss recognized last year related to an obligation to purchase at fair value the non-controlling interest in one of our joint ventures' investments, higher adjusted EBITDA, and lower restructuring, acquisition and other costs, partially offset by higher income tax expense. Adjusted net income increased by 12% this quarter, primarily as a result of higher adjusted EBITDA.

## Cash flow and available liquidity

This quarter, we generated cash provided by operating activities of $1,893 million (2023 - $1,754 million) and free cash flow of $915 million (2023 - $745 million), both of which increased primarily as a result of higher adjusted EBITDA.

As at September 30, 2024, we had $4.8 billion of available liquidity$^{2}$ (December 31, 2023 - $5.9 billion), consisting of $0.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $4.0 billion available under our bank and other credit facilities.

Our debt leverage ratio$^{2}$ as at September 30, 2024 was 4.6 (December 31, 2023 - 5.0, or 4.7 on an as adjusted basis to include trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of a combined Rogers and Shaw as if the Shaw Transaction had closed on January 1, 2023). See "Financial Condition" for more information.

We also returned $266 million in dividends to shareholders this quarter and we declared a $0.50 per share dividend on October 23, 2024.

## Service revenue

The 2% increase in service revenue this quarter and 5% increase year to date were primarily a result of the cumulative impact of growth in our mobile phone subscriber base over the past year, including our evolving mobile phone plans that increasingly bundle more services in the monthly service fee. The year to date increase was also affected by the impact of the Shaw Mobile subscribers acquired through the Shaw Transaction in April 2023.

Mobile phone ARPU remained stable this quarter and year to date.

The continued robust postpaid gross additions this quarter and year to date were a result of sales execution in a growing Canadian market. The decrease in gross additions this quarter was a result of a less active market and our focus on attracting subscribers to our premium 5G Rogers brand.

## Equipment revenue

The 1% decreases in equipment revenue this quarter and year to date were primarily a result of:

- · fewer device upgrades by existing customers; partially offset by
- an increase in new subscribers purchasing devices; and
- · a continued shift in the product mix towards higher-value devices.

## Operating costs

## Cost of equipment

The 1% increase in the cost of equipment this quarter and 2% increase year to date were a result of the equipment revenue changes discussed above.

## Other operating costs

The 5% decrease in other operating costs this quarter and 1% decrease year to date were primarily a result of:

- · lower costs associated with productivity and efficiency initiatives; partially offset by
- higher costs associated with our expanded network.

## Adjusted EBITDA

The 5% increase in adjusted EBITDA this quarter and 7% increase year to date were a result of the revenue and expense changes discussed above.

## Service revenue

The 1% decrease in service revenue this quarter was a result of:

- · continued competitive promotional activity; and
- declines in our Home Phone, Video, and Satellite subscriber bases.

The 17% increase in service revenue year to date was primarily a result of the completion of the Shaw Transaction in April 2023, which contributed an incremental approximately $1 billion in the first quarter, partially offset by the factors discussed above.

The lower ARPA this year was primarily a result of competitive promotional activity.

## Operating costs

The 8% decrease in operating costs this quarter was a result of the full realization of our synergy targets associated with the Shaw Transaction and ongoing cost efficiency initiatives. The 8% increase year to date reflects a full nine months of results for the Shaw Transaction, which closed in April 2023.

## Adjusted EBITDA

The 5% increase in adjusted EBITDA this quarter and 26% increase year to date were a result of the service revenue and expense changes discussed above.

One of our objectives is to build the biggest and best networks in the country. As we continually work towards this, we once again plan to spend more on our wireless and wireline networks this year than we have in the past several years. We continue to expand the reach and capacity of our 5G network (the largest 5G network in Canada as at September 30, 2024) across the country. We also continue to invest in fibre deployments, including fibre-to-thehome (FTTH), in our cable network and we are expanding our network footprint to reach more homes and businesses, including in rural, remote, and Indigenous communities.

These investments will strengthen network resilience and stability and will help us bridge the digital divide by expanding our network further into rural and underserved areas through participation in various programs and projects.

## Wireless

The decreases in capital expenditures in Wireless this quarter and year to date were due to the timing of investments. We continue to make investments in our network development and 5G deployment to expand our wireless network. The ongoing deployment of 3500 MHz spectrum and the commencement of 3800 MHz spectrum deployment continue to augment the capacity and resilience of our earlier 5G deployments in the 600 MHz spectrum band.

## Cable

The decrease in capital expenditures in Cable this quarter was due to the timing of investments. The increase year to date reflects a full nine months of results for the Shaw Transaction. Capital expenditures reflect continued investments in our infrastructure, including additional fibre deployments to increase our FTTH distribution. These investments incorporate the latest technologies to help deliver more bandwidth and an enhanced customer experience as we progress in our connected home roadmap, including service footprint expansion and upgrades to our DOCSIS 3.1 platform to evolve to DOCSIS 4.0, offering increased network resilience, stability, and faster download speeds over time.

## Media

The year to date increase in Media capital expenditures was a result of higher Toronto Blue Jays stadium infrastructure-related expenditures associated with the second phase of the Rogers Centre modernization project.

## Capital intensity

Capital intensity decreased this quarter and year to date as a result of the revenue and capital expenditure changes discussed above.

The Shaw Transaction-related costs in 2023 and 2024 consisted of incremental costs supporting acquisition (in 2023) and integration activities (in 2023 and 2024) related to the Shaw Transaction. In the first half of 2023, these costs primarily reflected closing-related fees, the Shaw Transaction-related employee retention program, and the cost of the tangible benefits package related to the broadcasting portion of the Shaw Transaction.

The restructuring and other costs in 2023 and 2024 were primarily severance and other departure-related costs associated with the targeted restructuring of our employee base, which also included costs associated with voluntary departure programs. These costs also included costs related to real estate rationalization programs and transaction costs related to other completed and potential acquisitions.

## Interest on borrowings, net

The 17% increase in net interest on borrowings year to date was primarily a result of:

- · a reduction in interest earned on restricted cash and cash equivalents, as we used these funds to partially fund the Shaw Transaction on April 3, 2023; and
- · interest expense associated with the long-term debt assumed through the Shaw Transaction; partially offset by
- the repayment at maturity of senior notes in March 2023, October 2023, November 2023, January 2024, and March 2024 at different underlying interest rates; and
- · lower interest expense associated with refinancing a significant portion of the borrowings under our term loan facility with senior notes issued in September 2023 and February 2024.

## Other expense (income)

The decreases in other expense this quarter and year to date were a result of a $422 million loss related to the change in the value of an obligation to purchase at fair value the non-controlling interest in one of our joint ventures' investments recorded in the prior year.

## Key Performance Indicators

We measure the success of our strategy using a number of key performance indicators that are defined and discussed in our 2023 Annual MD&A and this earnings release. We believe these key performance indicators allow us to appropriately measure our performance against our operating strategy and against the results of our peers and competitors. The following key performance indicators, some of which are supplementary financial measures (see "Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures"), are not measurements in accordance with IFRS. They include:

- · subscriber counts;
- · Wireless;
- Cable; and
- · homes passed (Cable);
- · Wireless subscriber churn (churn);
- Wireless mobile phone average revenue per user (ARPU);
